# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 12th, 2024 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: started by creating the base device component and adding some inputs/otuputs, as well as adding some methods to the device service 

**Thoughts:** I decided to ignore the library apsect for now and just create a basic application (which I alread no how to do). I can migrate this later. Was kind of unprepared for a project of this scale -- probably going to do some more planning. Realized I might have to use rxjs Subjects for a lot of inputs/outputs, as it seems like signals are more about push changes instead of timed events like message - I'll have to do some reasearch on the "laziness" of signals 

I also copied a bunch of type definitions from other projects (didn;t count this in my hour), which are basically the same as the RNBO ones, just moved around a bit, but it really helped to review all the data types (e.g. device, preset, buffer etc.. ) that I'm going to be working with, and sped up the process of coding.
