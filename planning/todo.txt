Ordered:

    1. List out the main inputs/outputs of the top-level exported component <ngx-rnbo-device>
    
    2. Figure out the sub components hierarchy
        * top-level by data type (e.g. a top-level messaging component, a top-level parameters components etc...)
        * container and layout components 
        * Actual gui components

    3. Figure out the data flows between components
    
    4. Figure out where Services are needed?
        * Root level services (e.g. a service for controlling audio)
        * Component level services (e.g. a service for controlling a single parameter instance) 
        * Pipes? (not sure when/if this would be necessary)
    5. Determine the inclusion of Angular Material elements in the GUI
        * Which elements to use?
        * which properties should be accessible to the device meta?
    6. Design the actual GUI using Figma/Canva ? 
    
    7. Do any additional publishing work
        * clean up the documentation
        * add some info links

Should be able to call a bindToParameter(id: string, subject: BehaviorSubject<number|string>)    

// Create a "generic" component for selecting objects with unique ids to interact with or display
